# Claims Application for Motor Insurance


As a user:

● I would like to submit a Motor Insurance claim form via website.

● I need to login in order to submit the claim form.

● I need to fill in the " Basic insured and driver details ", " Vehicle details ", " Loss
details " and " Documents required for claims " in the claim form.

● I can login to do modification on my claims or delete my claims as long as the
claim's status is under " In Progress ".

● If the claim status is " Accepted ", I cannot modify or delete the claim.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a claim agent:

● I can login to Django admin to view the claims submitted by the users.

● I can change the claim's status from “ In Progress ” to “ Accepted ” via Django
admin actions or edit the claim in Django admin.

● Functionality of claim agent only needed via Django admin.
